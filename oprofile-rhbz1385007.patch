commit 09bf741f18ae5830156ffbf3e33e933145601b06
Author: Maynard Johnson <maynardj@us.ibm.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 4 11:06:41 2014 -0600

    Lower the minimum count value for most marked events for POWER8
    
    With the IBM POWER8 processor, marked events occur at a substantially
    lower rate than with previous IBM Power processors.  This patch adjusts
    the minimum count value downwards on the marked events used by POWER8
    in order to try to attain a reasonable sampling rate.

commit a7d08172d5738f6e9b3e3ea68e585c1585f5ca21
Author: Maynard Johnson <maynardj@us.ibm.com>
Date:   Fri Nov 21 15:41:55 2014 -0600

    Add support for IBM Power event codes longer than sizeof int
    
    A small number of events on newer IBM Power processors have event codes
    that are larger than sizeof(int). Rather than change the width of the
    event code everywhere to be a long int (which would include having to
    change the sample file format), we have defined some internal-use-only
    unit masks for those events. These unit masks are not shown in the ophelp
    output, and IBM Power users should never use them in event specifications;
    instead, they should use the usual 'null' unit mask value of '0x0' in event
    specifications -- e.g.,
           PM_L1MISS_LAT_EXC_256:0x0:0:1
    
    See libpe_utils/op_pe_utils.cpp:_get_event_code for how these unit masks are
    used.

    Remove Powerpc OProfile events the kernel will reject
    
    This patch comments out a number of events with "## note 1" to indicate
    that the events are not supported.  A "note 1" is added to the beginning
    of the file explaining the issue.  The issue is the events require the
    setting of a register by the kernel when setting up to measure the
    events that is only writable by the hypervisor.  Currently, there is no
    API allowing the kernel to request the required field of the register be
    changed by the hypervisor.  The events can be re-enabled if an API is
    created for the OS to request the hypervisor set the bits.

+# These event requires the cache selector bits to be set to a non-zero

+# where the cache bits are ANDed with 0x7 if the unit is between 6 and 9.  If

    Remove unused Power 8 unit masks
    
    To prevent people from using PMU events that the kernel would reject
    on Power 8 commit 34715734fd6f commented out those events.  However,
    additional checks in oprofile code would note that some of the unit
    masks were unused due to those commented out events and prevent
    oprofile tools from running.  The unused unit masks have been
    commented out to pass these checks.

    Remove Powerpc OProfile events the kernel will reject
    
    Will, Rei:
    
    As I suspected in the last email, there is a second issue that has to do
    with what version of the libpfm library OProfile is using.  Initially a
    subset of the OProfile events for Power 8 were added to libpfm4.5.
    Later the complete set of events was added to libpfm4.6.  So, My first
    attempt at removing the events that perf was rejecting inadvertently
    included events that were in libpfm 4.6 but not libpfm 4.5.  My version
    of oprofile was used a patched version of libpfm 4.4 that effectively
    made it libpfm 4.5.  I redid the patch an verified that when Oprofile is
    built with libpfm 4.6 there are no rejected events.  I added a comment
    in the event file as a heads up to this effect.
    
    Please take a look at the patch and see if it works OK for you.  Sorry
    for the delay in getting this out.
    
               Carl Love
    
    ----------------------------
    
    Re-enable Power 8 events that the kernel does not reject.
    
    The previous patch to remove Power 8 events that were being rejected by
    the kernel also removed events that were actually being rejected by
    OProfile.  OProfile was rejecting the events on the test machine because
    the test machine used a version of libpfm that did not have all of the
    Power 8 events.  This patch re-enables the Power 8 events that are
    not rejected by the kernel.
    
    Libpfm 4.5 only contains a subset of all the available Power 8 events.
    The complete list of Power 8 events is supported by libpfm 4.6.  To use
    all of the events in this file, OProfile must be compiled with
    the libpfm 4.6 library or newer.  Otherwise, OProfile will reject the
    event if it is not in the libpfm 4.5 library.

    POWER 8 processor event spelling fixes
    
    Will:
    
    Here is a patch to fix the spelling errors in the Power 8 events.  See
    OProfile bugzilla number 281.  This patch corrects the spelling errors.
    
                       Carl Love
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    
    POWER 8 processor event spelling fixes.
    
    Fixed the spelling of six of the events.
